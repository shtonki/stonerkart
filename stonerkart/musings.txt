if we lose inputs it's because we don't buffer inputevents

things that are fucked:
martin
this code base
Map.dijkstra using Int32.MaxValue/2 to denote an uninitialized node
we up and load every fucking screen when loading the form
hexpanel has an event handler but we hardcode it's calls to controller because we're lazy and autistic
