missing features:
canceling targeting


thing which are up for debate:
drawing before selecting which mana orb to gain

things that are broken:
martin rectum
Tile.atDistance leaks memory


things that are fucked:
if we lose inputs it's because we don't buffer inputevents
martin
this code base
Map.dijkstra using Int32.MaxValue/2 to denote an uninitialized node
we up and load every fucking screen when loading the form
if cardViews start sending their shit twice or to the wrong place it's because we never remove the MouseDown callback because we're autistic
Card contructor
ManaButton image caching and how it's nonexistant and how that's fucked
targeting was rotten from the get go, still sort of is xd
Tile.atDistance should probably be in Map
