missing features:
lmfao as if there aren't any
things that are raised from the dead have their race set to undead


thing which are up for debate:
draw step before selecting which mana orb to gain


things that are broken:
martin rectum
Tile.atDistance leaks memory


things that are fucked:
AutoFontTextBox eats inputs like mouseEntered and mouseClicked
if we lose inputs it's because we don't buffer inputevents
martin
this code base
Map.dijkstra using Int32.MaxValue/2 to denote an uninitialized node
we up and load every fucking screen when loading the form
if cardViews start sending their shit twice or to the wrong place it's because we never remove the MouseDown callback because we're autistic
Tile.atDistance should probably be in Map
Card.path makes me :puke:
