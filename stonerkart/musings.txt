if we lose inputs it's because we don't buffer inputevents

things that are fucked:
martin
this code base
Map.dijkstra using Int32.MaxValue/2 to denote an uninitialized node
we up and load every fucking screen when loading the form
if cardViews start sending their shit twice or to the wrong place it's because we never remove the MouseDown callback because we're autistic
